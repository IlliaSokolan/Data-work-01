Learn working with data by POST method saving it to txt file

20/10/2021
Created this project in Node JS using Express package. I made a local server, then an html file with Form to add data of User (Name, Surename, age, email) 
and after submiting by method POST they are written in a file data.txt. 
With every POST it writes on next line in the Data.txt file

In the file it looks like:

{"name":"Vasya","surname":"Pupkin","age":"28","email":"pupkin@gmail.com"} 
{"name":"Petya","surname":"Ivanov","age":"30","email":"pupkin@gmail.com"}
